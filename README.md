## About this project

This project is to create a browser-based timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, using dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive interface, applying skills you've learned in this module.

### User Story

AS A coding boot camp student.
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

### Built With

- ![HTML]
- ![CSS]
- ![JAVASCRIPT]

### Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
  - Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  - When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Roadmap

They will be added as the pesudocode is made

- [x] Click the button and start the timer
  - [x] Display first question
  - [x] When the answer is clicked, show the next question
  - [x] If the answer is incorrect, subtract 5s from the timer
- [x] When the timer reaches 0, or all the quiz is answered, the quiz should be ended

- [x] User can see the history of highest score list in highscores page
  - [x] Display The list of score in the order of highest
  - [x] User can delete the score history by clicking clear score button
  - [] Refactor variable names and comments
  - [] Deploy the application

These roadmap result will look like thepicture below

The following mock-up animation demonstrates the application functionality:
